# PUTChess

## About

PUTChess is a C++ application that brings the game of chess to life in 3D using the OpenGL library.

## Functionality

The application reads chess games stored in the PGN (Portable Game Notation) format, a standard plain text format for recording chess games. It then replays the game move by move, allowing you to visualize the entire game in 3D. 

## How it Works

1. **Loading the Game**: The application reads a chess game from a PGN file. This file contains the recorded moves of a chess game.

2. **Visualizing the Game**: Using OpenGL, the application renders a 3D chess board and pieces. It then plays out the recorded game on this 3D board.

3. **Replaying the Game**: The application goes through the recorded moves one by one, moving the pieces on the 3D board accordingly. This allows you to watch the entire game play out move by move.
